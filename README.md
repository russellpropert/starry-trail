# Starry Trail

## Description
This project is screen art. If you are on desktop, the boxes on the screen will light when the mouse pointer is moved over them. If you are on mobile, swipe the screen and the boxes with light up. On both platforms, the mouse or your finger will leave a trail behind. The boxes will slowly fade over time.

## How To Run
Fork the repository and clone it to your machine. Drag the index.html file into your browser window. You can also see the project [here](https://starry-trail.vercel.app/), deployed on Vercel.

## Future Improvement
I'd like to make this more efficient. Right now, every box is in one array which gets checked on every event. I'd like to subdivide that array into many smaller arrays, only one of which would be checked based on the coordinates of the event.
